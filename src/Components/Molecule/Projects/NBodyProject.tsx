          Overview
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          An interactive 3D physics simulation that models gravitational
          interactions between multiple bodies in space. The simulation uses the
          Barnes-Hut algorithm to efficiently approximate gravitational forces
          between large numbers of particles, making it possible to simulate
          complex systems like galaxies and star clusters.

          Technical Implementation
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          The simulation is built using React Three Fiber for 3D rendering and
          implements the Barnes-Hut algorithm with an octree data structure for
          efficient force calculations. This optimization reduces the
          computational complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n), allowing for smooth
          simulation of hundreds of particles.

        <Typography paragraph>
          The simulation accurately models gravitational forces using Newton's
          law of universal gravitation. The Barnes-Hut approximation divides
          space into an octree structure, where distant groups of particles are
          approximated as single masses to reduce computational overhead while
          maintaining accuracy.
